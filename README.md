This project is a web application for managing appointments and contacts in a clinic, developed with Node.js and MySQL. It allows users to register, schedule appointments, submit feedback, and view relevant information intuitively. Additionally, it includes features for managing users and contact inquiries, enhancing efficiency in customer service.

APIs are created and integrated to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, optimizing data flow. Simulated services are implemented to test functionalities such as appointment management and user validation, ensuring robust development before final implementation. This results in a smoother experience for users and improves the application's responsiveness.
